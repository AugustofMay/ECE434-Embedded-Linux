# Etch-A-Sketch

## Reference Resources
I'm not very familiar with using the ncurses library, so I relied heavily on Pradeep Padala's "NCURSES Programming HOWTO" to implement this game.

## Setup
I've included a install.sh that should get everything up and running, essentially all it does is install the ncurses library.

## Playing
Uses the arrow keys to move, "e" to exit, and spacebar to shake the sketch away.
